            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>This website seeks to achieve two things. First is to allow users to have more flexibility and wider parameters when searching for flights. This is helpful if lets say you don't know the exact dates/nights/destination and instead of looking at every permutation, this should let you do it in 1 search where you can compare them all and save time. The second is to help users gauge a rough estimate as to what that flight should cost based on its distance and other details.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>On the main page there is a search box, in here you can fill in various parameters to search for flights. The details of what each one means will appear when you hover over the question mark. Using these parameters I query a search to Kiwi, the third party I'm using, which returns to me a bunch of flights that fit the criteria. These results are then processed by a model which tries to estimate a price based on the flight details and compares that to the actual price. This is the Expected Price.</p>

                <span>Is a minus percentage good or bad?</span>
                <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>A minus percentage indicates that the estimated price is higher than the average price for similar flights. This theoretically suggests that the flight may be a worse deal compared to others. Ideally the percentage should be positive, indicating a better deal. However, it's important to consider that the algorithm is not perfect as well as other factors such as flight duration, layovers, and overall convenience when evaluating a flight deal.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Probably not. While the algorithm aims to find the best deals, it is limited to just Kiwi's price and other providers may offer cheaper prices. Kiwi tends to offer the best price with funky layovers and multi-city trips.</p>

                <p>The Expected Price is an estimate of what a flight should cost based on various factors such as distance, duration, and quality. It was calculated using a model that analyzes these factors and their correlation with a large dataset of flight prices which are then used to make predictions, the code behind it is available on my GitHub.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It's ok. <strong>MAKE SURE TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE ESTIMATED PRICE IS IN LINE WITH THE PRICES AROUND IT AND WHAT YOU EXPECT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!</strong> Like with everything, please use common sense, if an hour flight is £400 and I've given it a good score that is most likely an error please don't buy it. There will probably be errors and so my best advice is to use it as a guide not a fact. The code is on my github if you would like to see it, improve it or use it. </p>

                <p>There are several types of searches you can perform on this website. The first is <strong>Search</strong> this is best for finding specific flights based on your criteria for a range of dates and destinations. The second is the <strong>Advanced Search</strong> which allows you to apply more filters and find flights that better match your specific needs, due to the increased user input it is also more prone to errors. The last is called <strong>Destination Search</strong> which is a feature which allows users to search for flights without knowing exactly where they want to go and what is well priced but know what kind of holiday they would like to have. On it you can also select/deselect specific destinations to your liking.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The destination scores are calculated using a mix of the internet and AI input. The scores themselves are not my personal opinion, I have seen it make mistakes and I am sure there are more which are innacurate. I am sorry if you don't agree with them and if there is one you think is wrong feel free to let me know and I can look into it to get an accurate score.</p>

                <p>The Big Trip Maker is a feature that allows you to plan a trip with multiple destinations. It hasn't been implemented yet but the idea is that you can select the countries you want to visit, and it will generate a list of potential flights and itineraries based on your preferences. This is particularly useful for long trips where you want to visit several places without having to search for each flight individually such as a gap year itinerary.</p>

                <p>Based on what I've read, for every price purchased using a link on my page, I get 4/3% of what you paid for it. As I understand it there should not be an increase in price between mine and Kiwi's website if so email me(info below). The plan is for the 4/3% is so that eventually I can run this algorithm on a server which would constantly have flights added to it and improve, then the rest would be for website charges and if there's more I'll spend it on offseting carbon emissions. </p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. It's only in euros as that is the currency I used in the algorithm. When you click on the link there should be somewhere on the top right of the Kiwi page where you can switch currency and language. </p>

                <p>If this is the case, select the flight you want to book for multiple people and on that page there will be an option where you can choose number of people. Booking together is also typically cheaper as airlines dynamically price flights meaning they get more expensive the more in demand they are. </p>

Unfortunately I cannot filter by cancellation policy as they do not provide me with that data. If you need a cancellation policy I would recommend booking through the airline as they offer the best cancellation policies and sometimes if its cheaper on Kiwi, they offer price matches.</p>

                <p>Yes, you can use this website for business travel, to search for business or first class flights use advanced search and under selected cabin switch it to what you would like. Unfortunately, I have trained my model using economy class data which means that the expected price and percentage off will be based on an economy flight with the same details so it may be wrong. If you have specific requirements for business travel, such as flexible tickets or additional services, I recommend checking directly with the airlines or using a dedicated business travel service.</p>

                <p><strong>1.</strong> Different return cities: Due to how the API works, the values I get for distance are only for the way there, because of this if I am flying to Los Angeles but returning from somewhere else which is a noticeable distance from the destination such as New York the value will be heavily skewed as the distance will be inaccurate. This won't be as bad with cities close to each other but it still gives a misleading final value. So if the return flight is different to the inbound flight, take the expected price with a grain of salt. You could search each leg individually to get a feel for the expected price.<strong>2.</strong> Searching for flights with a large number of destinations that are spread around the world. The problem is that the response Kiwi give me is limited to 1000 and is sorted by price, this means that if you try to search for flights which tend to vary substantially in price, it will only/mostly show the cheaper options. To get around this search in chunks separately for flights depending on the distance to origin. <strong>3.</strong> Some flights do not showup. This one is very frustrating, I have seen flights on Kiwi's website as well as other flight search engines, which have flights which mine simply does not show for some reason no matter however I tinker the search parameters. I am trying to fix this but I am not sure how or if I am even able to with the api.<strong>4.</strong>The algorithm penalises flights with longer layovers more heavily, which may not always align with user preferences for cheaper options or even if they want to explore a destination for a while. <strong>5.</strong>The algorithm doesn't take into account baggage meaning that when you ask for it in added baggage in advanced search the percentage will be lower than you want. The price will also be slightly off but not by a significant amount. If you want to see the percentage I would search without cabin baggage at first, look at the proper expected price and percentage and then after clicking on the link adding it there.</p>

                <p>Kiwi is a third party flight engine that allows users to book flights. I have flown with them before and think they are reliable but please remember they are a third party and make sure you are comfortable with using them before booking. There have been reports of bad customer service, the refunds can be slow and there is no 24-hour cancellation policy. I used them as I can search for flights easily using their api and I don't need to hadnle card trasactions using them. If you don't feel comfortable, search on another third party it should be similar in price.</p>
